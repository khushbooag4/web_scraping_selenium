Justin Williams and Tinman Kinetics have some great ways to use AI to tell the stories that ultimately elevate voices that usually get ignored. My work at DSST Public Schools in Denver, like so many educational organizations, is searching for the AI solutions, and how technology can be used to reach EVERY child . . . lifting them out of poverty and allowing their voices to be heard for social justice around the world. 

My work previous to One Voice 4 Change and DSST was developing a virtual connection to learning in a room called THE SYNK. https://stemk12.org/academics/the-synk/ 
I worked with the co-founder of Polycom to design an environment capable of experiential learning reaching everyone. Scrolling down to the stories you will see that we worked with China, Ukraine, and multiple rural schools in Colorado.

Freddy Rumeci,Communications Manager / Resource Mobilization,FVS-Amie des Enfants,"FVS-AMIE DES ENFANTS, formerly known as FVS-AMADE BURUNDI, is a non-profit association founded in 1992 by volunteers to help AIDS patients and their children. Following the armed conflicts in Burundi and the Great Lakes Region, FVS has committed itself to respond to the needs of many orphaned and vulnerable children (OVC): in 2021, ISTEEBU (Burundi's official statistics service) estimates that 73.9% of Burundians are living in poverty; and 8.4% of minors are orphans, particularly children aged 10-14 and 15-17 (12.6% and 17.4% respectively).FVS has resolved to work for the protection of the rights of OVC, their access to basic social services and the economic self-promotion of vulnerable households for the well-being of children. To achieve this, it has innovated by initiating a community-based approach to OVC care based on the value of solidarity according to the Burundian wisdom ""Umwana si uw'umwe"" (""a child does not belong to one person but to the whole community""). The approach consists in creating Child Protection Committees (CPC) in every community and Village Savings and Loan Associations (VLSA) or Solidarity Groups (SG) that work for the economic self-promotion of households and the care of OVC in their communities.Thus, the members of VSLA/SG contribute every week in 3 funds: the ""actions fund” to grant credits for income generating activities, the “mutual aid fund” to support the members of the SG and the “OVC fund” to buy and distribute school kits to vulnerable children. Indeed, among the many needs of OVC, FVS considers education to be the best service provided to an OVC child because it allows him/her to become an autonomous adult and responsible for his/her life and thus transform his/her life in a sustainable way.We have also created several institutions in order to strengthen our action. In order to sustain the access of OVC to quality education, the secondary school “Amie des Enfants” was created. To support the economic growth of the members of the VSLA, a microfinance institution, ""Dukuze Microfinance"", was created. The mutual health insurance ""TUZOKIRA TWESE"", the center for the promotion of solidarity entrepreneurship ""CPES"" which promotes solar lamps and the center ""Agateka k'abana"" for children's rights were also created.FVS is also recognized by the major development partners in Burundi. The ""OVC fund"", an innovation of FVS recognized by UNICEF as an essential asset for the sustainable improvement of education, has become a requirement for all UNICEF partner solidarity groups. And the government has recognized our Child Protection Committee approach as effective and sustainable: the Ministry of Social Action has integrated it into the national child protection policy since 2012 (FVS had been implementing it since 2002).",Fundraising techniques especially on self sustainability i.e running income generating projects that fund non profit service,Our experience with promoting and protecting vulnerable children's rights and well-being and our experience with village savings and loans associations in empowering and uplifting poor and vulnerable communities.

Katya Moniz (she/her),"Director, Global Microbiome Conservancy Program",OpenBiome,"OpenBiome advances global microbiome research to reduce disparities in health and scientific capacity.

The long version: OpenBiome is a non-profit microbiome health organization. We got our start 10 years ago as a stool bank, and have since provided almost 70,000 fecal microbiome transplants for patients with a debilitating and sometimes fatal gastrointestinal infection (C. difficile) that didn't respond to antibiotics. 

We focus on addressing gaps in microbiome research that are not being met by prevailing academic/biotech/pharma models, and where we believe the microbiome can provide an affordable, scalable solution to an urgent health need -- for example, severe acute childhood malnutrition.

My program at OpenBiome, the Global Microbiome Conservancy, specifically focuses on increasing global representation in microbiome science -- a field that has tremendous potential to improve health around the world but is vastly skewed towards US and European populations -- and building microbiome research capacity in the Global South. We are also developing a model for returning benefits (financial or in-kind) to the communities who participate in our research studies, and hope to offer this framework as a guide for equitable scientific practices more broadly.","I'd love to grow my network and meet more likeminded people at the intersection of science and its social impacts. I'm also seeking guidance on how to find funders who understand the value of inclusive, global science and research capacity -- and the importance and complexity of getting the ethics right. 

Finally, I'd love to gain perspectives from thought leaders in community empowerment, as well as stakeholders in Global South government, academia, industry, etc., on benefit-sharing, developing capacity and infrastructure, and building paths for rapid implementation of health interventions at scale.",Perspectives on science as a key tool for social and economic justice
